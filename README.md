# cyber-physical-bdi-agents

This project develops tools for programming what we call _cyber-physical BDI agents_, which are BDI agents that have a physical body. In these agents, perceptions include values obtained from physical sensors and the action repertory includes actions enabled by physical actuators.

The essential repositories of this project are listed below:

* [embedded-mas](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas): libraries for implementing cyber-physical agents, including for developing cyber-physical [Jason](https://github.com/jason-lang/jason) agents. This is the main repository of the project. Besides the libraries, it includes some basic examples.
* [embedded-mas-applications](https://github.com/embedded-mas/embedded-mas-applications): some applications developed with this framework.
* [jason-ros](https://github.com/embedded-mas/jason-ros): examples and resources for deploying ROS-based cyber-physical agents.
* [jason-ros-course](jason-ros-course-wesaac2024): a short introduction on programming cyber-physical agents with Jason and ROS.
* [javard](https://github.com/embedded-mas/javard): libraries for serial communication in cyber-physycal agents.
